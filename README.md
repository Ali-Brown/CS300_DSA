# CS300_DSA

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- Create and implement efficient algorithms to load data from validated file into a data structure, then iterate, sort, search, and print the data from the data structure.
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- By first writing out the algorithms necessary to accomplish task using different data structures and carrying out a runtime analsis to determine the best data structure for the problem.
## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- Carefully reading the accompanying class note and other online researches.
## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- This project helped me to understand the importance of data and data structures in the design of software, understanding the kind and volume of data a system will use and planning for it may impact the algorithmic efficiency of the system.
## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- This project helped me to come to the realization that we don't only write codes that work, but we must also write codes that works efficiently well with the kind of data structure our system must use.
